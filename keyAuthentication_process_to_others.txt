enabling private keybased login process to saii(he is external user, added to the server)

admin should ask saii for public key
root user can create a folder .ssh in /home/saii
	ownership of the folder should be on saii

inside .ssh we need to create a file called authorized_keys
	this file owner should be sai



with root access folow below steps

cd /home/saii/
mkdir .ssh
chown -R saii:saii .ssh ----->here -R means regressive.
chmod 700 -R .ssh/
cd .ssh
touch authorized_keys
vim authorized_keys -->inside place the saii public key properly and save the file make sure that no extra spaces
chown saii:saii authorized_keys
chmod 400 authorized_keys
ls -l
cd

then some configurations needs to change
vim /etc/ssh/sshd_config
uncomment PubkeyAuthentication yes and save it
sshd -t
systemctl restart sshd
